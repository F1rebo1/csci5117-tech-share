## What is Firebase?

Firebase is a Google product that helps developers build, manage and grow their apps easily. Developers can build their apps in a quick and secure
manner, and since no programming is needed on the firebase side it makes using its features much more efficient. Firebase provides services to android, ios, web and unity, it provides cloud storage, and it uses NoSQL for the database for the storage of data.

## What are some of the services it provides?

# Hosting
Firebase Hosting is a fast and secure way to host your web application or static content. It provides a global content delivery network (CDN) and SSL support out of the box, making your site fast and secure for users around the world.

# Realtime Database
Firebase Realtime Database is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON format and provides real-time synchronization across clients. This means that changes made by one client are immediately reflected on all other clients, making it easy to build collaborative applications.

# Authentication
Firebase Authentication provides an easy-to-use authentication system that allows users to sign up and sign in to your application using various methods such as email/password, Google, Facebook, and more. It also integrates with Firebase's other services such as Cloud Storage and Realtime Database.

# Cloud Storage
Firebase Cloud Storage is a powerful and simple way to store and retrieve files in the cloud. It provides a scalable, secure, and reliable infrastructure for storing user-generated content such as images, videos, and documents.

# Cloud Messaging
Firebase Cloud Messaging allows you to send messages and notifications to users across platforms such as iOS, Android, and the web. It provides a simple and reliable way to send messages at no cost, making it easy to keep your users engaged and informed.

# Analytics
Firebase Analytics provides insights into how users are interacting with your application. It allows you to track user behavior, measure performance, and gain insights to help you make data-driven decisions to improve your application.

### Setup Your Environment

Run the following 2 commands:
```npm install```\
```npm start```
